            <p>These are two projects to demonstrate skills in working with HTML, CSS, and jQuery.</p>
              <p>The first project, PaintBox, utilizes the Draggable and Droppable tools.
                The second project is a responsive website called Bike Shop, which utilizes Datepicker and Autocomplete widgets.</p>

          <p>This project is a game to demonstrate JavaScript language skills.
            <p><b>Game rules:</b></p>
            <p>You need to click on cards with icons to open them.
            The game doesn't allow the player to open more than two cards simultaneously.
            If the cards have the same image, they will remain open; otherwise, they will flip back.
            The goal of the game is to open all the cards in the shortest time possible.</p>
            The speed rating is evaluated with stars in the top left corner.</p>

            <p>This single-page application provides the user with a list of highly-rated venues in the selected area.</p>
              <p>The venues are presented to the user with detailed information from the <b>FourSquare API</b>, including menus, locations, opening hours,
              and ratings.</p>
              <p>To select an area, a search bar with a dynamic dropdown list is used, which loads information from the <b>Google API</b>.
                The user is free to search for a location based on geographical location, street name, districts, cities, or zip codes.
                 Once the user selects a location, it is displayed on a map from the <b>Google API</b> with markers for all the establishments in that area.

            <p>The main goal of this project is an application with a task list, where tasks are presented in a hierarchical tree structure. This provides a more intuitive and user-friendly way for individuals to perceive complex goals.</p>

            <p>At this stage, the application displays tasks with two sub-levels of structure. In the next step, the application will be transitioned into a graphical tree structure. Below is an animation from the working project.</p>
            <p>For the project, a domain name has been acquired: <a href="https://mindsgraph.com">www.mindsgraph.com</a>, and work is currently underway to deploy it on Amazon Web Services.</p>
